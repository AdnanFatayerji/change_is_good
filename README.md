## Introduction

The purpose is to give a token of appreciation to our fearless leader - a token in which we try to provide back some of the love that he has been sharing with us over the last months / years.

This is the place where we will put together all the input / quotes for the token to Kristof.  If you want to contribute please put your contribution in a file in the quotes directory.

All is welcome - if you think of someone that is missing here - please tell him about this.
