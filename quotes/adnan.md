The Alchemist is one of the first books I was gifted and I wanted to share a quote that captures a small part of its beauty and wisdom:

“When we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too.” 
― Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist

This quote applys to all of us and has become the main pillar of our foundation and our lifes journey.
