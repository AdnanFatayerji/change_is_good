"People can feel real Ikigai only when they proceed toward self-realization, in love and happiness, in their encounters with others, and through a sense of the value of life."
Kobayashi Tsukasa

Dear Kristof, I came across the beautiful concept of Ikagi recently.

When expressed in this simple form:

"Ikigai is the process of allowing the self's possibilities to blossom"

I thought, perhaps, you might like it as much as I did.
