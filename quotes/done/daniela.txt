\chapterprecishere{``I believe that we are here to create Heaven on Earth. I do believe that every seed planted with love can grow into a flower, that every blossom can turn into a bloom under the warmth of a loving touch. I do believe that miracles indeed happen when the intention is love. I believe that people like you, Kristof are the ones who can and do change the world, making it a better place for all living beings. Thank you for being a creator, for making a difference, for including me in your journey. May Divine Love surround you and be you, always.‚Äù
